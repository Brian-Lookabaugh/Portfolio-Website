My name is Brian Lookabaugh and I have a passion for uncovering patterns and learning new things. In 2018, I was first introduced to the fact that modern advacements in data collection and statistical analyses allowed researchers to robustly examine and predict virtually *anything*. Finding out that researchers had the capacity to predict when civil wars would occur, examine what factors lead to quality democracy, evaluate development policies in developing countries and more opened up an exciting career avenue for me. In part, this fascinating realization drove my desire to work on a PhD and write a dissertation. Currently, I am in the final phase of my PhD program and I spend my work hours writing my dissertation, working on independent projects and picking up/honing data-related skills. This website details examples from my work. My hope with this website is that the provision of these resources both demonstrate my skills in data analysis while also aiding others who may be working on similar projects and happen to find themselves on this website. <br>

## [Project 1: Building a Conflict Recurrence Data Set with Stata](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Brian-Lookabaugh/Portfolio-Website/blob/main/BuildingConflictRecurrenceDataset.html) <br>
Conflict recurrence, the phenomenon where countries who have recently resolved civil wars subsequently return to civil war, is a major sub-field in the civil war and conflict management literatures. Despite this prominence, data sets on conflict *recurrence* specifically are not readily avaliable. Contemporary data sets often include information on conflict itself. However, such data sets provide the inverse information that is needed for the study of conflict recurrence given that this area of research studies peace-year observations, rather than conflict-year observations. Still, information on prior conflicts is crucial to the study of conflict recurrence given that many of the strongest predictors of conflict recurrence are features of prior civil wars. These issues only partially reflect the many obstacles facing researchers who seek to quantitatively analyze covariates of conflict recurrence. In order to assist these researchers, this project walks through the construction of a conflict recurrence data set aggregated at the country-year level.
