My name is Brian Lookabaugh and I have a passion for uncovering patterns and learning new things. In 2018, I was first introduced to the fact that modern advacements in data collection and statistical analyses allowed researchers to robustly examine and predict virtually *anything*. Finding out that researchers had the capacity to predict when civil wars would occur, examine what factors lead to quality democracy, evaluate development policies in developing countries and more opened up an exciting career avenue for me. In part, this fascinating realization drove my desire to work on a PhD and write a dissertation. Currently, I am in the final phase of my PhD program and I spend my work hours writing my dissertation, working on independent projects and picking up/honing data-related skills. This website details examples from my work. My hope with this website is that the provision of these resources both demonstrate my skills in data analysis while also aiding others who may be working on similar projects and happen to find themselves on this website. <br>

## [Project 1: Building a Conflict Recurrence Data Set with Stata](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Brian-Lookabaugh/Conflict-Recurrence-Dataset-Construction-Chapter1-Dissertation/blob/main/BuildingConflictRecurrenceDataset.html) <br>
**Objective**: The goal of this project was to construct a national-level conflict recurrence data set. This was a particular challenge given that contemporary civil war data sets are aggregated at a sub-national level (warring party dyads). Further, information concerning prior civil wars is also needed while *only including* post-conflict observations. To study conflict recurrence, a data set is needed that transforms the format of contemporary civil war data sets. <br>
**Data Sets Used**: Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) sources, Mullenbach Peacekeeping Operations data, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Social Conflict in Africa (SCAD), Drazanova Ethnic Fractionalization data. <br> 
**Program Used**: Stata <br>
**Results**: The complete construction of a conflict recurrence data set aggregated at the country-year level. In addition, common covariates of civil war recurrence are included, containing information both about the *prior* civil war and about the *current* post-war environment. <br>

## [Project 2: Explaining Why Non-Governmental Organizations Turn to the "Dark Side"](Link Project)
**Objective** <br>
**Data Sets Used** <br>
**Program Used** <br>
**Tools and Models Used** <br>
**Results** <br>
Many scholars and policymakers have argued that non-state actors (such as advocacy groups, religious organizations, civil society, etc.) have an important role in the peacebuilding process for post-conflict countries. However, while still a minority, an alternative set of individuals have argued that non-state actors may have a "darker side" which may translate to higher rates of post-conflict violence and a higher probability of conflict recurrence. This project seeks to quantitatively assess these arguments. Using survival analysis, this project investigates the conditionalities that make non-state actors, in particular, civil society, more prone to violence than peace. <br>

## [Project 3: Assessing the Effectiveness of Non-State Actor Peacebuilding Efforts](Link Project)
**Objective** <br>
**Data Sets Used** <br>
**Program Used** <br>
**Tools and Models Used** <br>
**Results** <br>
While our understanding on the potential negative effects of non-state actors for post-conflict peace is not clear, our knowledge on *how* non-state actors theoretically contribute to post-conflict peace is also limimted. Because non-state actors have been linked to numerous types of peacebuilding efforts, this project analyzes how consequential these actors are towards various types of peacebuilding activities.
